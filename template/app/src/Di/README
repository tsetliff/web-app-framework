The class here is chosen by the environment variable set in config.php in the root app directory.  It will also
assign that to be the class that the method is run on when you use it within your controller classes.

Every method should be defined on the Di class and then over ridden in an environment specific class.

This allows you to return different objects based on if it is production or development for example if you use a
different logger like MonoLog in production.
